# basketball-data-analysis
Overview: Our project is going to portray and analyze various trends that have come up in basketball in the last 30 years. We wish to use the methods learned in class to portray various information through charts and graphs about how basketball is played. The information show will help us analyze how the style of gameplay has changed over the years on both sides of the ball.

Dataset: httos://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA stats_ per poss.html (A website containing basketball data from every season since 1950s)

Methods we are going to apply: We will project our data using several different graphs; for example, we can use line graphs/ bar graphs to show different basketball statistics over time and also use linear regression to calculate various statistics for future seasons that will help us come to a strong conclusion. If linear regression is not an option then what we are going to do is analyze clusters of teams using K-means clustering.
